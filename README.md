# Design Patterns
A list of design patterns I have gone through.


# How to test?

Each example is autoloaded using PSR-4 and a test example is found in `test.php`.
Simply run `php test.php`.

# Where do these examples comes from?

Most of them come from an ebook  I bought called **Understanding Design Patterns**. The explanation is great, however most coding
examples contains errors.

I have gone through each of them and fixed the bugs!
